    <p>
        I do door-to-door voter registration in Nashville with the Davidson County Democratic Party.

    <!-- TODO voter rights restoration -->
    <p>
        When we encounter individuals who have lost their right to vote for felony convictions long ago and often unfounded or trivial, we supply them with information from Project Return to help them restore their right to vote.
        We are working building the capacity to work people through the process ourselves.

        If you live in Tennessee, you can now register to vote online through the Tennessee Democratic Party at <a href="https://www.tnvotes.org/">https://tnvotes.org/</a>.
