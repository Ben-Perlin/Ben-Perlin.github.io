        I do door-to-door voter registration in Nashville with the Davidson County Democratic Party.

    <!-- TODO issues with voter suppression -->
    <p>
        As it stands now, Tennessee ranks 40th in the nation for voter registration and dead last in voter turnout.

        Tennessee Congressman Jim Cooper (D-5) articulates this problem by pointing “we had a very hot 2015 mayor’s race here in Nashville and there were fewer voters there than we had in this city in 1971”

    <!-- TODO voter rights restoration -->
    <p>
        When we encounter individuals who have lost their right to vote for felony convictions long ago and often unfounded or trivial, we supply them with information from Project Return to help them restore their right to vote.
        We are working building the capacity to work people through the process ourselves.
